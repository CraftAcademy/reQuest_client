        <h3>The big idea - You get what you give</h3>
        <p>
          reQuest is an app for people helping each other with an in-app
          currency (karma points) as reward.
        </p>
        <p>
          So in order to have people help you with reQuests, you need to help
          others with their Quests.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can post a reQuest for a certain task to be done. People can
          respond to reQuests and say that they can do it. You both agree on the
          reward.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the task is done you pay the person that performed the task with
          in-app currency (karma points). Then you can rate each other, so that
          trust-worthy people will get a higher rating.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to get started , you will need to create an account to post
          and respond to reQuests.
