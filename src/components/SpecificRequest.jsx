            <h3>The big idea - You get what you give</h3>
            <p>reQuest is an app for people helping each other with an in-app currency (karma points) as reward.</p>
            <p>So in order to have people help you with reQuests, you need to help others with their Quests.</p>
            <p>
              You can post a reQuest for a certain task to be done.
              People  can respond to reQuests and say that they can do it.   You both agree on the reward.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the task is done you pay the person that performed the task with in-app currency (karma points).
              Then you can rate each other, so that trust-worthy people will get a higher rating.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to  get started , you will need to create an account to post and respond to reQuests.
